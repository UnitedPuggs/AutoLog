Just a little something something to keep track of maintenance on my vehicles :)

Mostly experimental, so don't expect super high-quality code here lol

## How to run

Pull this thang, give 'er a lil `npm i`, make sure you've got Rust installed, then run `npm run tauri dev` and start up PocketBase with `./pb/pocketbase serve` and tada you've got your own little AutoLog.

Maybe I'll add an executable in the future, but for the time being this is it.
